autonomy.py is started on boot by the autonomy script in /etc/init.d/

the /lidar/ folder contains a c++ implementation which reads LIDAR (not used)
the /old/ folder contains testing scripts and earlier implementations. Some are open source scripts from Adafruit etc. examples which were tweaked to test individual implementations.
